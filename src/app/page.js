          <p class="flex text-primary dark:text-white text-justify indent-8 mb-8 font-semibold">
            A clean and well-organized classroom plays a vital role in improving the learning environment. Once students enter a clean space, they tend to feel comfortable and are encouraged to focus on their lessons. Unfortunately, many classrooms are filled with trash and dust, which not only disrupts the learning environment but also affects the health of students and teachers.
          </p>

          <h1 className="text-2xl dark:text-white font-semibold underline mb-5 animate-pulse">Argument</h1>
          <p class="flex text-primary dark:text-white text-justify indent-8 mb-8 font-semibold">
            First and foremost, a messy and dirty classroom can be distracting. When trash piles up in corners or dirty desk drawers, students may find it difficult to concentrate on their studies. The presence of trash creates an unpleasant environment that reduces the sense of order and discipline. Students may become more focused on the messy environment than on their studies, leading to a decrease in their interest in learning.
          </p>

          <p class="flex text-primary dark:text-white text-justify indent-8 mb-8 font-semibold">
            Second, in addition to inhibiting concentration, dusty and trashy classrooms can have a negative impact on health. Dust particles that accumulate on surfaces, especially over time, can cause respiratory problems, trigger allergies or asthma attacks in sensitive individuals. On the other hand, trash can attract bacteria and cause unpleasant odors. This not only affects the health of students but also teachers, potentially causing a breeding ground for diseases such as: respiratory tract infections, skin infections.
          </p>
          <h1 className="text-2xl dark:text-white font-semibold underline mb-5 animate-pulse">Recommendation</h1>
          <p class="flex text-primary dark:text-white text-justify indent-8 mb-8 font-semibold">
            Our suggestion for a clean and comfortable classroom for learning is that regular cleaning should be done to keep the classroom environment healthy and comfortable for learning. Students should help each other clean the floor from dust and tidy up the tables regularly, and throw away trash in the right place. Schools can offer various programs that teach the importance of cleanliness and personal responsibility in maintaining the classroom. It is important to maintain cleanliness where everyone should be aware of a clean classroom because students spend most of their day at school especially in the classroom.
